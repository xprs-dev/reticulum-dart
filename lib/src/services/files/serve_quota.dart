/*
 * ServeQuota — the serving-side budget + anti-abuse guard for the file layer.
 *
 * A node decides how much of its uplink it is willing to spend serving others.
 * Three guards, in order of strength:
 *   1. servingAllowed — a hard off switch (e.g. set false on cellular when the
 *      user opted out of serving on metered data).
 *   2. a GLOBAL daily byte budget (default 1 GB/day) — the hard backstop that
 *      holds even against identity/link rotation.
 *   3. a PER-REQUESTER daily byte budget — so one peer can't drain the whole
 *      budget, plus a manifest refetch window so a peer can't restart the same
 *      full download over and over within a short window (chunks are gated only
 *      by the byte budgets, so a normal chunked download is never blocked).
 *
 * Requester identity over an anonymous link is weak (linkId), so the per-
 * requester guard is best-effort; the global budget is the real protection.
